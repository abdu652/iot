## Smart Sensor Tracking System with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi

This project is a real-time data tracking system using an ESP32 and a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to monitor temperature, pressure, air quality, and light levels. The Raspberry Pi acts as an MQTT broker and Node.js server, managing data with PostgreSQL and Socket.IO.

🌡️📊 **Features**:
- **Real-Time Updates**: Sensor data updates every 5 seconds, with values displayed on a live web dashboard.
- **Historical Data Queries**: Easily query past sensor data to view trends and insights.

This setup enables seamless, continuous tracking with interactive visualizations for effective monitoring.
